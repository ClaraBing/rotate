# Rotate
**Planar rotation**  
*Input*: image name, output filename, angle (in radius)  
- Please use only positive angles: e.g. use pi \* 3/4 instead of -pi/4  

*Output*: square image containing the rotated image w/ all other pixles padded by the image mean  
  
**ToDo**  
- Perspective change (i.e. rotation around arbitrary axes)
